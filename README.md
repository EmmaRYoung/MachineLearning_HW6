Implement K-Mean algorithms in Python

Implement K-Mean algorithms in Python (donâ€™t use existing implementations) and
apply it to MNIST database to cluster the data. Use K=7, 10, 12 and report Entropy
and Purity of the found clusters using different K values. Use i) Euclidean and ii) Manhattan distance as
your function and no changes in the number of assigned points to clusters as your
stopping criterion. Report the mean and variance of each cluster (plot them as an
image). If your algorithm is slow and takes more than 20 minutes to run, randomly
select 25% of the data. Only work on the training dataset.
